what i would also call for , however , is to look beyond immediate concerns in biarritz .
we , as elected representatives , are at least as responsible for encouraging it to make progress in the face of adversity as we are for relaying the messages that we receive from public opinion in each of our countries .
with an eye to recent events , the issue of petrol prices also seems to me to be particularly noteworthy .
at present , the council is talking about incorporating such mechanisms in article 7 .
secondly , it lies in its transparency for the public , who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply european law , and in its transparency for those who do precisely that , draft or apply european law .
i agree with him that the commission must continue to play a pivotal role as guardian of the common interests of the community .
that is why i believe it is very important for the chairman of the eurogroup - which we chose to set up - to continue to play a full role in this area .
i for my part believe that it is precisely for this reason that the convention method is a good one and that ample use should again be made of it in the future .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your kind accolade and thank you also to those who have gently reproached me for not making this speech earlier .
we must work on closer cooperation and make it simpler and more effective in order to bring this about : closer cooperation is the immediate , simplest way forward if we are to take that additional step towards integration , the need for which has been confirmed by the many powerful speeches which i have heard today .
