PURPOSE:
****************************************************************************
Extract_Tmx_Corpus_1.043 is a Windows program (Windows 7, Vista and XP supported) that enables translators not necessarily with a deep knowledge of linguistic tools to create highly customised corpora that can be used with the Moses machine translation system and with other systems. Some users call it "et cetera", playing a bit with its initials (ETC) and meaning that it can treat a never-ending number of files. 

In order to create corpora that are most useful to train machine translation systems, one should strive to include segments that are relevant for the task in hand. One of the ways of finding such segments could involve the usage of previous translation memory files (TMX files). This way the corpora could be customised for the person or for the type of task in question. The present program uses such files as input.

The program can create strictly aligned corpora for a single pair of languages, several pairs of languages or all the pairs of languages contained in the TMX files. 

The program creates 2 separate files (UTF-8 format; Unix line endings) for each language pair that it processes: one for the starting language and another for the destination language. The lines of a given TMX translation unit are placed in strictly the same line in both files. The program suppresses empty TMX translation units, as well as those where the text for the first language is the same as that of the second language (like translation units consisting solely of numbers, or those in which the first language segment has not been translated into the second language). If you are interested in another format of corpus, it should be relatively easy to adapt this format to the format you are interested in.

The program also informs about errors that might occur during processing and creates a file that lists the name(s) of the TMX files that caused them, as well as a separate one listing the files successfully treated and the number of segments extracted for the language pair.

****************************************************************************
PERFORMANCE:
****************************************************************************
The program can process very large numbers of TMX files (tens of thousands or more). It can also process extremely big TMX files (500 MB or more; it successfully processed a 2,3 GB file). The extraction of the corpus of a pair of languages in a very large (6,15 GB) set of TMX files took approximately 45 minutes in a  Intel Core 2 Solo U3500 computer @ 1.4 GHz with 4 GB RAM.

The starting language and the destination language segments can be in any order in the TMX files (e.g., the starting language segment may be found either before or after the destination language segment in one, several or all translation units of the TMX file).

The program accepts and preserves text in any language (including special diacritical characters), but has only been tested with European Union official languages.
****************************************************************************
REQUIREMENTS: 
****************************************************************************
These requirements only apply if you want to use the program from source. If you have downloaded the Windows executable you do not have to do anything.
The program requires the following to be pre-installed in your computer:

1) Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/);
NOTE1: the program should work with Python 2.6, but has not been tested with it.
NOTE2: if you use Windows Vista, launch the following installation programs by right-clicking their file in Windows Explorer and choosing the command "Execute as administrator" in the contextual menu.
2) wxPython 2.8, Unicode version (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php);
3) Pythoncard 0.8.2 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythoncard/files/PythonCard/0.8.2/PythonCard-0.8.2.win32.exe/download)

****************************************************************************
INSTALLATION:
****************************************************************************
1) Download the Extract_TMX_Corpus_1.043.exe file.
2) Double-click it and follow the wizard instructions.
***IMPORTANT***: Never erase the file "LanguageCodes.txt" in that directory. It is necessary for telling the program the languages that it has to process. If your TMX files use language codes that are different from those contained in this file, please replace the codes contained in the file with the codes used in your TMX files. You can always add or delete new codes to this file (when the program is not running).

****************************************************************************
HOW TO USE:
****************************************************************************
1) Create a directory where you will copy the TMX files that you want to process.
2) Copy the TMX files to that directory. 
Note: If you do not have such files, try the following site: http://langtech.jrc.it/DGT-TM.html#Download. It contains the European Union DGT's Translation Memory, containing legislative documents of the European Union. For more details, see http://wt.jrc.it/lt/Acquis/DGT_TU_1.0/data/. These files are compressed in zip format and need to be unzipped before they can be used.
3) Launch the program.
4) Operate on the main window of the program in the direction from top to bottom:
a) Click the "Select input/output directory" button to tell the root directory where the TMX files are (this directory can have subdirectories, all of which will also be processed), as well as where the output files produced by the program will be placed;


NOTE: Please take note of this directory because the result files will also be placed there.
b) In case you want to extract a ***single*** pair of languages, choose them in the "Starting Language" and "Destination Language" comboboxes. Do nothing if you want to extract more than one pair of languages.
c) Click the "Select base name of output file" button and choose a base name for the output files (default: "Corpus.txt").
Note: This base name is used to compose the names of the output files, which will also include the names of the starting and destination languages. If you accept the default "Corpus.txt" and choose "EN-GB" as starting language and "PT-PT" as destination language, for that corpus pair the respective corpora files will be named, respectively, "EN-GB (PT-PT)_Corpus.txt" and "PT-PT (EN-GB)_Corpus.txt".
***TIP***: The base name is useful for getting different names for different corpora of the same language.
d) Click one (***just one***) of the following buttons:
- "Extract one corpus": this creates a single pair of strictly aligned corpora in the languages chosen in the "Starting Language" and "Destination Language" comboboxes;
-"Extract all corpora": this extracts all the combination pairs of languages for all the languages available in the "Starting Language" and "Destination language" comboboxes; if a language pair does not have segments of both languages in all of the translation units of all the TMX files, the result will be two empty corpora files for that language pair. If, however, there is just a single relevant translation unit, the corpus won’t be empty.
-"Extract some corpora": this extracts the pairs of languages listed in the file "LanguagePairs.txt". Each line of this file has the following structure: 
  {Starting Language}/{Destination Language}. 

Here is an example of a file with 2 lines:

EN-GB/PT-PT
FR-FR/PT-PT

This will create corpora for 4 pairs of languages: EN-PT, PT-EN and FR-PT and PT-FR. A sample "LanguagePairs.txt" comes with the program to serve as an example. Customise it to your needs respecting the syntax described above.
NOTE: Never erase the "LanguagePairs.txt" file and always make sure that each pair of languages that you choose does exist in your TMX files. Otherwise, you won't get any results.

The “Extract some corpora” and “Extract all corpora” functions are particularly useful if you want to prepare corpora for several or many language pairs. If your TMX files have translation units in all of the languages you are interested in, put them in a single directory (it can have subdirectories) and use those functions!

****************************************************************************
GETTING THE RESULTS:
****************************************************************************
The results are the aligned corpora files, as well as other files indicating how well the processing was done.

When the processing is finished, you will find the corpora files in the directory you have chosen when you selected "Select input/output directory". In the "_processing_info" subdirectory of that directory you will find one or more *errors.txt file(s), listing the name of the TMX files that caused an error, and *actions.txt file(s), listing the files that were successfully processed as well as the number of translation units extracted.

If you ask for the extraction of several corpora at once, you'll get lots of corpora files. If you feel somewhat confused by that abundance, please note 2 things:
a) If you sort the files by order of modified date, you'll reconstitute the chronological order in which the corpora were made (corpora are always made in pairs one after the other);
b) The name of the corpora file has the following structure: 

{Language of the segments} ({Language with which they are aligned})_{Base name of the corpus}.txt
Ex: the file "BG-01 (MT-01)_Corpus.txt" has segments in the BG-01 (Bulgarian) language that also have a translation in the MT-01 (Maltese) language and corresponds to the corpus whose base name is "Corpus.txt". There should be an equivalent "MT-01 (BG-01)_Corpus.txt", this time with all the Maltese segments that have a translation in Bulgarian. Together, these 2 files constitute an aligned corpus ready to be fed to Moses.

You can now feed Moses your customised corpora :-)
