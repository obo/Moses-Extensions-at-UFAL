  <h1>Thanks</h1>
  <ul>
   <li><B>Maria Jos&eacute; Machado</B>, whose suggestions and research have influenced significantly the <I>scorer-moses-irstlm-randlm</I> script. She helped in the evaluation of Moses output in general and organised, together with Hil&aacute;rio, a comparative evaluation, made by professional translators, of the qualitative results of Google, Moses and a rule-based MT engine. She suggested a deep restructuring of the Help-Tutorial file. </li>
   <li><B>Hil&aacute;rio Leal Fontes</B>, who made very helpful suggestions and comprehensive tests. He is the author of the <I>breaking_prefixes.pt</I> script (for the Portuguese language). He has compiled the corpora that were used to train Moses and to test these scripts, including 2 very large corpora with 6.6 and 12 million <i>segments</i>. He has also revised the Help file.</li>
   <li><B>Tom Hoar</B>, who consolidated the previous documentation into the Quick-Start-Guide.doc to help users to get up to speed very quickly.</li>
   <li><B>Manuel Tomas Carrasco Benitez</B>, whose <a href="http://dragoman.org/xdossier/" >Xdossier</a> was used to create the pack of the Moses-for-Mere-Mortals files.</li>
   <li><B>Gary Daine</B>, who made helpful remarks and who contributed code for Extract_TMX_Corpus.</li>
  <li>Authors of the <a href="http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/fosmt-moses.html" >http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/fosmt-moses.html</a> (<b>Mikel Forcada</b> and <b>Francis Tyers</b>) and of the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses_steps.html" >http://www.statmt.org/moses_steps.html</a> pages. These pages have helped me a lot in the first steps with Moses.</li>
   <li>Authors of the documentation of Moses, giza-pp, MGIZA, IRSTLM and RandLM; some of the commentaries of the present scripts describing the various settings include citations of them.</li>
   <li>European Commission's Joint Research Center and Directorate-General for Translation for the <a href="http://wt.jrc.it/lt/Acquis/DGT_TU_1.0/data/" >DGT-TM Acquis</a> - freely available on the JRC website and providing aligned corpora of about 1 million segments of Community law texts in 22 languages- which was used in the demonstration corpus. Please note that only European Community legislation printed in the paper edition of the Official Journal of the European Union is deemed authentic.</li>
