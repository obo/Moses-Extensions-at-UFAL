The Budget directly covers loans to Member States granted or guaranteed by the Community.
There were no disbursements under macro financial assistance during the second half of 2008.
A new disbursement of USD 22 million for a Euratom loan took place in October 2008.
A first tranche of EUR 2000 million of the Balance of Payments loan granted to Hungary was disbursed in December 2008 (see section 3.5).
Regarding EIB financing operations, a total amount of EUR 5 943 million had been signed by the EIB under the general mandate 2007-2013 (Council Decision 2006/1016/EC).
Concerning the disbursement volume, an amount of EUR 2 052 million was disbursed during the second half of 2008 of which EUR 643 million was disbursed under the new general mandate 2007-2013.
It should be noted that, following an action undertaken by the Parliament, on 6 November 2008 the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2006/1016/EC on the grounds that it should have been adopted under a dual legal basis.
The Court, while annulling the Decision, ordered “that its effects be maintained for EIB financing arrangements entered into before the entry into force, within a period of 12 months from the date of delivery of this judgement, of a new decision adopted on the appropriate legal basis, namely Articles 179 EC and 181a EC together”.
The Commission adopted a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council to replace the annulled decision on 14 January 2009.
The risk borne by the Budget is based on the exposure assessment and derives from the outstanding amount of capital and interest in respect of guaranteed operations.
Defaulting operations will be covered by the Fund when they are linked to third countries (68% of the total outstanding amount guaranteed as of 31 December 2008) and directly by the Budget where Member States are involved (loans to or for the benefit of projects in Member States account for the remaining 32% of the total outstanding amount guaranteed).
The large proportion of guaranteed loans linked to Member States is the result of the recent enlargement rounds and the activation of the Community medium-term financial assistance facility for Member States not having adopted the EUR.
According to Article 1, third paragraph, of the Fund Regulation, once a country becomes a Member State, the risk on the loans is transferred from the Fund to the Budget.
For the purpose of this report, two methods are used for evaluating the risks borne by the Budget (either directly or indirectly via the Fund):
The method of calculating the total amount of capital outstanding for the operations concerned on a given date including accrued interest.
This methodology gives the level of risk supported by the Budget on a given date.
The budgetary approach defined as "the annual risk borne by the Budget" is based on the calculation of the maximum amount which the Community would have to pay out in a financial year assuming that all guaranteed loans are in default.
On 2 December 2008, the ceiling for the maximum amount of loans being granted to non Euro-area Member States under the BOP facility was increased from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion.
Council Decision 09/102/EC of 4 November 2008.
One tranche of EUR 2 000 million was disbursed in December 2008.
Another tranche of EUR 2 000 million was disbursed in March 2009.
Two additional tranches are planned to be disbursed during the year 2009 for a total amount of EUR 2500 million.
A second loan to Latvia was granted in early 2009 for up to EUR 3100 million.
The loan will be disbursed in several tranches in 2009.
On 18 May 2009, the limit on the outstanding amount to be granted to the Member States outside the Euro area was increased from EUR 25 billion to EUR 50 billion.
Macro-financial assistance loans
MFA loans to third countries are subject to individual decisions by the Council.
The financial assistance granted under Council Decision 2007/860/EC of 10 December 2007 providing macro-financial assistance to Lebanon consists of EUR 50 million in loans and up to EUR 30 million in grants.
The loan part will be disbursed in two equal tranches in 2009.
Euratom loans
The Euratom lending to Member States or in certain eligible non-member countries (Russian Federation, Armenia, Ukraine) has a ceiling of EUR 4 billion of which around 85% have already been used.
The remaining margin is about EUR 600 million.
EIB loans
The previous general mandate to the EIB expired on 31 July 2007.
At this date, contracts corresponding to a total 98% of the overall ceiling under this mandate (EUR 20 060 million – see Table A5 of the SWD) had been signed.
At 31 December 2008, a total amount of EUR 5 307 million remained to be disbursed under this mandate and should be disbursed within 10 years from the end of the mandate, as the guarantee of the Community lapses at the end of this period.
See Article 1.06 of the Restated and Amended Guarantee Agreement signed between the EC and the EIB on 30 August/2 September 2005.
The most important item that will impact the risk for the Budget in future is the Community guarantee granted to the EIB under the general mandate 2007-2013.
The Community guarantee is restricted to 65% of the aggregate amount of credit disbursed and guarantees provided under EIB Financing Operations, less amounts reimbursed and plus all related sums, with a maximum ceiling of EUR 27 800 million.
Broken down into a basic ceiling of a fixed maximum amount of EUR 25 800 million and an optional mandate of EUR 2 000 million to be decided upon by the Council.
A total amount of EUR 5943 million had been signed at 31 December 2008 under this mandate, of which EUR 5053 million was undisbursed at that date (see Table A6 of the SWD).
The Commission draws on its cash resources in order to avoid delays and resulting costs in servicing its borrowing operations when a debtor is late in paying the Commission.
See Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 94/728/EC, Euratom, on the system of the Communities' own resources.
No appropriation was requested under Budget Article 01 04 01, "European Community guarantees for lending operations", as no default was recorded in the second half of 2008.
Opinion No. 2/2009
OLAF’s Reports of Investigations that have been in progress for more than nine months
Brussels, 28 May 2009
priority is given to other cases which were opened some time previously;
long periods of inactivity (from four or five, up to 11 months) after collection of documents in missions to third countries or the copy of data, without further examination in cases where very small or non-estimated economic impact were observed.
In all of these cases the number of investigators in charge was aligned with or exceeded the proposal for staff allocation indicated by the evaluator in the “assessment of initial information”.
In some cases the reason “lack of resources” is explained as a lack of staff resources due to a temporary absence of the investigator in charge.
Four cases giving this reason were examined (7 % of cases in this sector transmitted to the SC).
In those cases the reason “lack of resources” is explained in detail and refers to the workload of investigators in charge together with the average priority of the case in question, or linked to the lack of investigators in OLAF with the required linguistic skills.
Occasionally it was noted that no explanation was given to justify the lack of resources in a high priority case with, in principle, adequate staff allocation.
Nine cases giving this reason were examined (19 % of cases in this sector transmitted to the SC).
In some cases, contradictory reasons were ticked in the "nine months reports”:
“significant resources”, “complexity of the case” and “lack of resources”.
Moreover, the SC noted that in some cases, following the decision to open a case, OLAF would either await completion of external audits for several months without undertaking any investigation acts.
In other cases, the real reason as mentioned in other sections of the model form, is the complexity of the case and the volume of investigation work, or “lack of time” without further explanation.
The mention of the reason “lack of resources” for not having concluded the investigation in a nine months period is not justified in most of the cases examined.
This is a matter of particular concern for the SC taking into consideration that OLAF’s demands for increasing the number of staff in the annual budget would also be, in principle, based on an analysis of the “lack of resources” in the investigations and operations field.
Therefore, scrupulous attention should be paid to this matter.
This is also relevant for the SC given the fact that the SC is consulted on the annual draft budget for OLAF.
Any inaccuracy in pointing out this reason could lead to misleading conclusions in terms of OLAF budget.
The indication of this reason should be explained in detail in the nine months report.
Moreover, practical solutions to remedy this situation should be envisaged and explained in each and every report where this reason is mentioned.
Higher operational priorities are mentioned in one of the cases and reasons for not working full time on a case are clearly explained, including solutions to remedy the lack of resources situation.
Six cases giving this reason were examined.
All cases mention the same reason to justify their non completion:
“lack of resources and important volume of the investigative work”;
however, apart from one of them, no explanations are given to allow an understanding of any of those two reasons.
Occasionally, the underlying reason for delay corresponds to co-operation with other Commission services.
External Aid
It was noted that in all those cases, “tactical hold in investigation” corresponded to OLAF waiting for the completion of audits carried out by external firms, or no further investigation activities were conducted by OLAF.
Prudent use should be made of the reason “tactical hold” to keep an investigation open and it should be explained in detail in order to have a clear view of the investigation strategy.
Those investigations which are still active where this reason is indicated should be revisited and particular attention given to those dating from the nine month reports received in 2007.
“LACK OF RESOURCES”
Internal Investigations
Nine cases citing this reason were examined (19 % of cases in this sector transmitted to the SC).
The SC noted that reasons for delays are divergent and common to several cases:
In all those cases, the number of investigators in charge is adequate (it varies from two to four) and some investigations are still active, whereas others took more than two years to complete them.
The SC noted with concern that investigations with “no financial detriment to the European Commission funds” as described in the report were opened and missions to third countries in cases with low economic impact have taken place.
It was also observed that contradictory reasons for some investigations not having been completed have been ticked in the model report:
e.g. “significant resources were allocated” and “low priority combined with limited resource allocation”, nevertheless in the latter, on the spot missions to third countries have taken place.
In all the above referred cases the number of investigators in charge seems to be adequate and is not in question.
As for the staff resources, the number of investigators seems to be adequate in relation to the volume of investigative work and to the work plan suggestions and it was not questioned in any of the cases.
Some of these cases have a very low financial impact or even no financial impact on European Community funds.
The fact that these reports are formally visaed countersigned – "visaed" – by management (Head of Unit and Director), reveals that an unsatisfactory level of attention to the internal control of investigations.
When reference is made to “limited resource allocation” it should be clearly explained in order to avoid misleading conclusions regarding staff allocation and OLAF financial resources.
The evaluation assessment which is presented to the Board should include a cost-efficiency evaluation and an overview of the staff resources of the Unit.
The allocation of those investigators to other cases, the number of cases which are still pending and categorised as “high priority” that could require the allocation of the investigators in question to other cases should also be mentioned.
These cases are well described and well explained and the timeframe for the completion of cases has been respected.
OLAF intervention is accurate.
Both “low priority and limited resource allocation” are well justified within the content of the reports.
No investigations have been initiated since they were seen not to be cost-effective.
Only “basic verification techniques have been applied and appear to indicate a risk of irregularities in the awarding of project funding”.
If the case is of “low priority” it is perhaps unnecessary to open an external investigation.
Conclusions:
The reason for non completion of case was well justified and explained and the cost-efficiency evaluation was carried out.
“LACK OF CO-OPERATION”
Lack of co-operation by the Member State (MS)
Seven case reports were received by the SC in 2007 and six in 2008.
One case giving this reason was examined (2% of cases in this sector transmitted to the SC).
Apart from the customs sector where the nine months reports have been correctly used as a management tool to revisit the investigation needs, explanations are required in order to understand the reasons indicated for non-completion of cases.
COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS
Policy Coherence for Development - Establishing the policy framework for a whole–of–the-Union approach
General commitment to Policy Coherence for Development
The need for a new approach
The growing impact of internal policies in external relations
Growing non-ODA financial flows to developing countries
Using the EU's strengthened CPD mechanisms and prioritisation
The developing countries' perspective
Establishing the policy framework for a whole-of-the-Union approach
Putting the new approach into practice
Conclusion
The third wave of the economic and financial crisis has reached the shores of the developing world, hitting these countries much harder than originally expected.
COM(2009) 160 final, 8.4.2009:
"Supporting Developing Countries in Coping with the Crisis", and SEC(2009) 445/2, 8.4.2009:
"Millennium Development Goals: Impact of the Financial Crisis on Developing Countries".
The forecasts for the second half of 2009 and for 2010 look bleak.
See also "The Millennium Development Goals Report", United Nations, 2009.
Sustaining the development aid effort is essential, albeit not sufficient.
In financial terms this means that Official Development Assistance (ODA) must be complemented by other financial sources.
Harnessing the development potential of these additional financial flows depends on efforts by developing countries and by their external partners such as the EU to design development friendly policy frameworks.
The crisis illustrates the extent to which national economies have become dependent on each other and how one set of policies - namely in the financial sphere - impacts on others and on developing countries.
But the financial crisis is just one example.
Close interactions at the economic level have led to a situation where almost all policy decisions taken in developed countries have either direct or indirect consequences for developing countries and their capacity to combat poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The 2008 EU Research paper on MDGs identifies three categories of factors that influence progress towards the MDGs:
Paper produced in the framework of the European Report on Development,
developing countries own policies;
development cooperation;
and the global policy framework, including EU policies and their impact on developing countries.
Acknowledging the importance of all three categories, this communication will focus on EU policies.
Despite this clear evidence of the importance of Policy Coherence for Development (CPD) and the fact that the principle is agreed at political level, the concept is complex and governments are still struggling to implement it.
Further efforts are needed to operationalise CPD.
The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, for example, is currently considering how to "deepen and accelerate its work to promote policy coherence for development".
See reflection exercise:
Building on the two first biennial EU Reports on CPD and the call to establish a whole–of–the-Union approach , this Communication will look at the EU's approach to CPD and will make suggestions to the Community and the Member States on how to use CPD in a more targeted, effective and strategic way.
EU commitment to CPD is founded as regards its legal base, on article 178 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in a more general way on article 3, second subparagraph, of the Treaty on European Union on consistency between all the Union's policies and its external activities.
The Treaty of Lisbon, if ratified, would give a solid legal base to CPD.
Article 10a of the Treaty on European Union in the chapter on the general provisions on the Union's external action sets out sustainable development and the eradication of poverty as objectives of the Union's external action and stipulates that the EU shall pursue this objective in the development and implementation of the different areas of the Union's external action and of the external aspects of its other policies.
Article 188d of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is the new version of the 178 coherence article worded almost identically.
The political framework for CPD was set by the Communication on CPD in April 2005, the subsequent Council Conclusions in May 2005, the European Consensus on Development in December 2005, and the Council Conclusions on the EU CPD report in November 2007.
CPD commitments in specific areas were made in particular with the Council conclusions on security and development and those on migration both of them adopted in November 2007, as well as the Council conclusions of May 2008 subsequent to the Commission Staff Working Paper on CPD, on Climate Change/Energy/Biofuels, Migration and Research.
Beyond those twelve areas commitments were also taken for instance with regard to good governance in the tax area where positive synergies with development objectives will be further sought by the Commission.
COM(2009) 201, 28.4.2009, Communication on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters;
COM(2009) 160, 8.4.2009, Communication on Supporting Developing Countries in Coping with the Crisis.
The EU has substantially strengthened its approach towards CPD over the recent years.
In a first phase it concentrated itself on the commitments for CPD made in 2005.
The concrete steps were the specific commitments taken in the twelve policy areas.
Trade, Environment, Climate Change, Security, Agriculture, Fisheries, Social Dimension of globalisation, employment and decent work, Migration, Research, Information Society, Transport, Energy.
The second phase is characterised by efforts to implement these commitments, the sharpening of the mechanisms to promote CPD such as impact assessment, inter service consultation, as well as their more effective use in particular through the establishment of a Presidency CPD work programme and the ex ante identification of the main planned initiatives of the Commission that might affect developing countries.
Like the first EU CPD report issued in 2007the 2009 CPD report assesses progress made in the twelve policy areas as well as with regard to institutional mechanisms.
EU Report on Policy Coherence for Development.
Member States, generally speaking, are positive about the overall progress achieved since 2007, as illustrated in the graph below covering EU (Community and Member States) performance.
Chart based on Member States responses to a dedicated CPD 2009 questionnaire prepared by the European Commission.
A good example for positive synergies created between different policies is the recent package on climate change and energy, which offers tremendous opportunities for the production and use of sustainable biofuels in developing countries.
Now the situation is different.
Due to closer interactions and ever intensifying globalisation the side effects of other EU policies on developing countries have become much more systematic.
Examples are numerous from regulations in the areas of environment or consumer protection, to decisions in the areas of migration or security.
As the dividing line between external and internal policies is becoming more blurred sometimes to the extent of losing both its empirical evidence and its political value the concept of CPD needs to be taken into account more systematically.
The increasing impact of EU policies on developing countries is mirrored by growing non-ODA financial flows to developing countries.
Both public non-ODA and private financial flows to developing countries have been growing substantially over recent years, including to Africa.
The impact of these financial flows on development depends first and foremost on the quality and the development friendliness of the policy framework.
Efforts to enhance the coherence of policies with development objectives are therefore of utmost importance.
The current crisis has, by stopping and even reversing this rising trend, demonstrated the importance of these flows.
In the light of these developments the Council Conclusions on the crisis stress the importance of mobilising all possible sources of financing for development, underlining the importance of development-oriented support in the areas of research and technology, peace and security, migration, renewable energies and climate change.
Council Conclusions on Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis, § 15.
In order to make these financial flows work for development the Council emphasises the importance of the policy framework and suggests that the EU develops a 'whole–of–the-Union' approach, taking into account all instruments and processes and respecting CPD.
Reporting on progress in the twelve policy areas has raised people's awareness of CPD.
It has allowed the EU to develop the necessary instruments and expertise to promote CPD.
As a result the EU is now in a position to adopt a more pro-active and focussed approach to CPD.
The OECD DAC review of EC development policy in 2007 already suggested reviewing the agenda of policy coherence commitments to ensure that attention and allocation of resources are used for priority areas.
REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION
Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid - (ECHO)
Annual Report 2008
DG ECHO does not implement assistance programmes itself.
It is a donor who implements its mission by funding Community humanitarian actions through partners who have signed either the Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) such as European NGOs and International Organisations (Red Cross family) or the Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement (FAFA) for the UN agencies.
DG ECHO’s task is to ensure that goods and services get to crisis zones fast through its partners.
The rapidity of aid delivery is facilitated by special provisions in the Financial Regulation and their implementing measures.
These structural arrangements also enable DG ECHO to deploy technical assistants (ECHO experts) in the field thereby ensuring identification of vulnerable sections of society, an accurate assessment of needs, a rapid identification of suitable partners and projects to meet such needs.
This is followed up by on-the-spot monitoring of partners' and projects' progress in order to ensure sound financial management in support of the declaration of assurance that resources have been used for their intended purpose.
Based on its experience in responding to disasters, DG ECHO also works at promoting disaster preparedness in order to reduce both vulnerability and exposure of people to risks and disasters as well as to reduce the economic costs of such disasters.
With a view to the effective discharge of its mandate, DG ECHO may support – where appropriate and necessary – capacity building measures of its implementing partners.
The current report is being issued in compliance with the requirement of art. 19 of the Humanitarian Aid regulation:
At the close of each financial year, the Commission shall submit an annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council with a summary of operations financed in the course of that year.
The summary shall contain information concerning the agencies with which humanitarian operations have been implemented.
The report shall also include a review of any outside assessment exercises which may have been conducted on specific operations".
This report sums up DG ECHO's main activities implemented in 2008.
The annex provides an extensive overview of the operations funded in the various countries and regions where DG ECHO provides assistance through its partners and statistics extracted from the 2008 financial report.
General policy aspects
Although the humanitarian situation throughout the world does not change drastically from one year to the next, humanitarian needs continue to remain high and interventions are increasing in terms of frequency.
In the last decade, the number of natural disasters has increased substantially, mainly due to the effects of climate change.
Nine out of every ten disasters are now climate-related and over the past two decades, the number of recorded disasters has doubled.
Natural events often turn out to be disasters, because of the high level of vulnerability and lack of coping capacity of populations, in particular in developing countries.
In parallel to these disasters whose origin is partly found in human behaviour, the number of conflicts has not changed significantly but tend to last longer and increasingly destructive.
The consequence is an increasing demand on global humanitarian aid.
The challenge humanitarian donors like DG ECHO face is to keep a necessary equilibrium between the funding of actions aimed at prevention of humanitarian disasters and quick response to emergencies, be they natural or man-made.
On a policy level, the signing of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid by the Presidents of the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission in December 2007, followed by the adoption of an action plan, is a considerable step forward for the European Union which has finally given itself a common set of values, principles and objectives intended to strengthen the coherence of its overall humanitarian action.
OJ C 25 – 30/1/2008.
SEC(2008) 1991 – May 2008.
The Consensus stresses the importance of the principle of diversity of the implementing partners and, as such, recognises that each of these bodies has comparative advantages in the response to specific situations or circumstances.
As part of the implementation of the action plan, a conference on International Humanitarian Law was held at the European Parliament on 16th September 2008.
Finally, in March, the Commission adopted a communication on "reinforcing the Union's Disaster Response Capacity", to respond to increasing challenges whether they come from natural disasters or man-made crises and in order to reinforce the Union's capacity to provide civil protection and humanitarian assistance either on its own territory or in third countries.
Global overview of DG ECHO’s humanitarian operations in 2008
Overall situation
Through its Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO), the Commission provides humanitarian assistance to the victims of natural or man-made disasters in third countries, on the sole basis of humanitarian needs.
This year, the Commission's needs-based response to humanitarian crises in over 60 countries was channelled through 90 funding decisions, totalling €937 million.
The initial budget of €751 million was reinforced on several occasions in order to respond to new crises and natural disasters occurring during the year and also, most importantly, in order to reply to soaring food prices.
In 2008, DG ECHO had to deal with the effect of soaring food prices.
As a result of the surge in the prices of basic food aid products and oil, the cost of responding to the humanitarian needs identified for 2008 escalated significantly.
Furthermore, the poor populations' vulnerability to crises increased as they have to devote more of their limited resources to food purchases.
In order to tackle the short-term effect of rising food prices, the budget for DG ECHO's emergency food assistance almost doubled in 2008, with additional resources drawn from the Emergency Aid Reserve.
At the end of the year, the food aid budget was €363 million, allowing aid to reach out to more than 25 million people.
In addition to the food crisis, natural disasters accentuated by climate change, continue to increase both in frequency and severity, affecting more frequently and more severely already vulnerable populations.
Natural disasters created serious damage in the following geographical areas in 2008:
cyclones/hurricanes in the Caribbean region, affecting Haiti, Bahamas, Cuba, Madagascar and in Burma/Myanmar;
droughts in the Horn of Africa, Sahel, Moldova, Paraguay, Honduras and Palestinian territories;
earthquakes in China;
epidemics in Benin, Latin America and the Caribbean;
floods in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nepal, Namibia, India, Nepal and Yemen;
period of extreme cold in Peru and Bolivia and typhoons in Laos and Vietnam.
The Commission had to respond speedily to help thousands of suffering people, who in some cases already affected by other crises.
In terms of "man-made" crises, the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation in South Ossetia in August led to emergency intervention in favour of the population affected by this new conflict.
The post-election violence led to the displacement of more than 500,000 people.
In 2008, Yemen experienced an escalation of the internal conflict in the north of the country.
In August, the failed signature of a peace agreement between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Government of Philippines sparked renewed fighting in the southern island of Mindanao, causing the displacement of more than 550,000 people.
At year end, around 320,000 people remained displaced, with no perspective of a solution in sight.
Finally, in Sri Lanka, the government revoked the 2002 ceasefire agreement and intensified their offensive in the north of the country.
In addition to these new crises, the Commission had to manage worsening humanitarian situations often involving protracted, complex emergencies dating from previous years.
The two main examples are Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Through its humanitarian aid budget – food aid included –, the EU provided humanitarian assistance to an estimated 143 million beneficiaries in third countries.
In addition, 18.5 million of people were supported in respect of disaster preparedness, by strengthening community resilience and local response capacity.
The Commission allocated a total of €552 million (i.e. 58.9% of its total final budget) to ACP countries, the largest recipient of DG ECHO's funding, followed by Asia and Latin America (€192 million – 20.5%) and Eastern Europe, New Independent States, Middle East and Mediterranean countries (€156 million – 16.3%).
Middle East and NIS
The Commission continued its response to the serious humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip which did not show any improvement in 2008, in spite of the resumption of structural assistance to the Palestinian Authority in December 2007.
Funding of €82.8 million was provided to cover food needs of the most vulnerable population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
€30 million was also used to respond to the humanitarian and food needs resulting from the Iraqi crisis for beneficiaries inside and outside Iraq.
In the Northern Caucasus, the Commission pursued its funding to the victims of the Chechnya conflict in approving a total amount of €11 million.
Asia
€39 million was allocated to help people in Burma/Myanmar affected by cyclone Nargis which hit the country, €36.3 million targeted vulnerable people affected by the conflicts and natural disasters in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
An additional €351,000 was allocated to support the (Burmese) Rohingya refugees present in Bangladesh.
Finally, €34 million were allocated to Latin America of which €12.5 million for the victims of the Colombian conflict and the rest in response to several natural disasters, such as the La Niña phenomenon in Bolivia and Ecuador, drought in Paraguay and Honduras, cold waves in Bolivia and Peru and floods in Guatemala and Honduras.
Comparative analysis
If one looks at a five-year perspective, it should also be pointed out that the funding for the various regions and areas of the world is very variable, which confirms that DG ECHO intervention is by nature and definition short-term oriented.
It should also be noted that over 96% of the humanitarian aid budget is for funding humanitarian operations, whereas less then 4% is for support and administrative expenditure (information, audits, evaluations, support staff, etc.).
See annex, section VIII.
Disaster Risk Reduction including disaster preparedness activities
As part of its mandate, DG ECHO finances activities to prepare for and reduce risks faced by the most vulnerable communities and those most exposed to natural disasters.
Considering the increasing awareness of the importance of preparedness, the substantial rise in the number and intensity of disasters over the last decades and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 that calls for all governments and international organisations to prioritise and invest in Disaster Risk Reduction, DG ECHO has stepped up its funding for community-based disaster preparedness over the past years and is prepared to further refine its approach.
Whilst remaining within the limits of its humanitarian mandate, DG ECHO can support a multitude of actions by making use of its proven strengths.
DG ECHO's contribution to DRR is channelled through its DIPECHO programme, drought preparedness initiatives, the integration of disaster preparedness measures in relief operations and advocacy efforts.
At the same time, activities have been started which are intended to strengthen capacities of the local public institutions responsible for protecting their populations.
Disaster preparedness activities are implemented through a wide range of partners who are working in close collaboration with local organisations, which makes access to the most vulnerable and marginalised communities easier.
With its new action plan launched in South East Africa, DG ECHO is now present in seven regions of the world particularly prone to natural disasters.
Linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD)
In that perspective, DG ECHO is actively engaged in implementing a linkage strategy between relief, rehabilitation and development “LRRD” and in developing stronger cooperation with other Commission services or donors.
Main partners in the humanitarian operations
The humanitarian aid provided by DG ECHO is implemented through partners.
DG ECHO works with about 200 non-governmental organisations, United Nations agencies and International Organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Societies.
Having a wide and diverse range of partners is important for DG ECHO, ensuring efficient coverage of an increasing list of needs all over the world.
DG ECHO has developed close working relationships with its partners at the level of both policy issues and management of humanitarian operations.
In 2008, DG ECHO implemented its humanitarian operations through NGOs (44%), United Nations agencies (46%) and International organisations (10%).
During the year, DG ECHO reviewed, reassessed and refined the partnership agreements governing relations with its partners, by streamlining the procedures without compromising the control over the monitoring and supervision of the aid delivered.
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)
Multi-annual Indicative Planning Document
(MIPD)
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Executive Summary
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was initialled in December 2007 following progress in the four key areas.
full co-operation with the ICTY;
adoption and implementation of all necessary public broadcasting legislation;
4) developing the legislative framework and administrative capacity to allow for proper implementation of the SAA.
After the adoption of the two police laws in April 2008, the SAA was signed in June 2008 together with an Interim Agreement which focuses on trade and other Community-related competencies.
Law on Independent and Supervisory Bodies of the Police Structure of BiH and Law on Directorate for Coordination of Police Bodies and Agencies for Support of Police Structure of BiH.
The Interim Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2008.
The BiH presidency ratified the SAA in November 2008.
Since the preparation of the precedent strategy papers (MIPD 2007 – 2009 and MIPD 2008 - 2010), Bosnia and Herzegovina has made only limited progress in implementing the remaining reforms required by the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP).
It is a continuing and considerable challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina to comply with the political requirements of the SAP by increasing the effectiveness of its executive and legislative bodies, improving co-ordination between the State and Entities and to agree on the reform of its police structure.
IPA can assist in the strengthening of administrative capacity, can support domestic efforts on constitutional reform, and can assist in the reform of the police and the judicial system.
The Commission will consider those risks in the programming of its assistance.
To continue support for the political criteria, this MIPD places further emphasis on the civil society dialogue, the development of independent and professional media and the preservation of the cultural heritage.
IPA can assist in the fight against corruption and support Bosnia and Herzegovina in meeting its obligations towards returnees, minorities and vulnerable groups.
Several economic indicators raise concerns, including the high unemployment rates and external imbalances.
In addition, slippages in public spending create obstacles to social and economic recovery.
To assist the country in complying with the economic criteria of the SAP, IPA can support stabilising the macro-economic environment and reducing and improving the quality of public spending to create a favourable business climate.
The reform of the education system and of the labour market and the development of a research policy should contribute to foster employment.
Further sectors supported under the economic requirements are trade, health, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and local economic development.
IPA offers assistance to soften the impact of the financial and economic crisis on Bosnia and Herzegovina by stepping up its cooperation with International Financing Institutions and by enforcing its efforts to support the development of SMEs and to support the institution-building of regulators and supervisors in the financial sector.
Bosnia and Herzegovina made so far only limited progress in the approximation of its legislation and policies with the acquis.
To assist the country in complying with the acquis-related requirements of the SAP, IPA can support the development and the implementation of strategies and policies to approximate to the European acquis in the areas of internal market, sectoral policies and justice, freedom and security.
IPA places emphasis on agriculture and rural development, transport and energy.
Support is also provided for the environment, quality infrastructure, customs and taxation.
Assistance under the Cross-Border Cooperation component is supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in cooperation with its neighbours Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia, its participation in the Adriatic IPA cross-border programme with EU Member States and other Western Balkan Countries (Albania, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia) and in the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) transnational programmes "South East Europe" and "Mediterranean".
As a potential candidate country, Bosnia and Herzegovina benefits from the first two components of IPA;
component I for Transition Assistance and Institution Building and component II for Cross-Border Cooperation.
The indicative allocation to Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Multi-annual Indicative Financial Framework (MIFF) for 2009-2011 amounts to EUR 303.2 million.
IPA assistance for the period 2009 – 2011 will build on assistance programmed under IPA in 2007 and 2008, the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation Programme (CARDS) 2001 – 2006 and the earlier PHARE and OBNOVA programmes (1995 – 2000).
In particular, IPA will make use of the institutions, the strategies, and the existing pipeline of projects which have been developed and supported under preceding programmes.
IPA is implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the European Commission Delegation as a centralised managed programme.
In October 2008, the Government designated a National IPA Coordinator (the State Minister of Finance and Treasury), who acts as the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina vis-à-vis the European Commission.
He is supported by the Directorate for European Integration (DEI).
The European Commission and Bosnia and Herzegovina have set up a Programming Management Committee and a Project Programming Committee, both composed of representatives of DEI and the Commission Delegation to ensure that the programming of Community assistance is adequately co-ordinated.
The revised MIPD takes into account the recommendations of the 2008 Progress Report and is consistent with the 2008 European Partnership and the Enlargement Strategy.
Since the end of the war in 1995, Community assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina has totalled EUR 2.8 billion.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Community provided more than EUR 540 million for humanitarian assistance.
The PHARE, OBNOVA and CARDS programmes provided more than EUR 1 billion to Bosnia and Herzegovina, of which EUR 503 million under the CARDS programme in the years 2001 to 2006.
IPA has provided EUR 137 million since 2007.
While the first years of OBNOVA and CARDS focused on the restoration of the infrastructure and the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, the emphasis since 2003 shifted to institution-building and to assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina in complying with the priorities of the European Partnership.
The priorities of CARDS in the years 2005 and 2006 were democratic stabilisation, good governance and institution building, including administrative capacities and justice and home affairs, and economic and social development, including environment and the participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Community programmes.
Since 2007, through its national and multi-beneficiary programmes, IPA addresses the political and economic requirements in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process and approximation to European Standards, mainly to support Bosnia and Herzegovina to establish regulatory systems and preparing for IPA pre-structural funds, and supports the participation in cross-border cooperation programmes with neighbouring countries and EU Member States.
The Tempus programme has provided considerable support for the modernisation and the reform of the higher education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Since 1997, Tempus has funded almost 90 cooperation projects with EU higher education institutions in the areas of curriculum development, university management and structural reform.
The programme has been highly effective in developing human resources and building capacity in public administration bodies, civil society, and industry.
It has also generally led to greater cooperation, not just through Tempus, but more importantly, at the national level.
Bosnia and Herzegovina benefits from the regional CARDS programme (now the IPA multi-beneficiary programme), which supports measures of common interest in the Western Balkans, such as infrastructure development, institution building, the implementation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and regional trade integration and cross-border cooperation.
The budget for the regional CARDS programmes for the period 2002 to 2006 amounts to EUR 280 million with a further EUR 241.1 million for IPA since 2007.
In addition, the regional programme supported areas of key importance for European integration, such as taxation and customs, statistics, public administration via the OECD Support for Improvement in Governance and Management (SIGMA) and horizontal support via the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office (TAIEX).
Inter alia, important achievements of the regional programme include cooperation between regional prosecutors and mutual legal assistance between the courts, improved police cooperation, integrated border management and cooperation on migration issues.
Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a focus country for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
Support for de-mining was provided under the Anti-Land Mines Action Programme.
Bosnia and Herzegovina benefited from the LIFE Third Country environmental programme with a focus on integrating environmental activities.
LIFE projects promoted successfully capacity building of environmental institutions such as waterworks association and the development of environmental tools and technologies including cleaner production techniques, control of diffuse sources of pollution, and action plans for wetlands.
From 2002 to 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina benefited from EUR 60 million of EC macro-financial assistance (MFA), composed of a EUR 20 million loan component and a EUR 40 million grant element.
This MFA successfully contributed to macro-economic stability, by easing the country's external financial constraints and improving the foreign reserves position.
The MFA conditionality which covered areas like public finance and administration reform, financial sector reform, private sector development and the business environment had a positive impact on the growth potential of the economy.
EC assistance was successful in the reconstruction of infrastructure after the war and in supporting the return of refugees and displaced persons.
Bosnia and Herzegovina benefited from integrated reconstruction programmes involving buildings, houses, water and energy and transport networks.
For returnees, more than 40,000 houses were reconstructed, hand in hand with the rebuilding of health centres, schools and the revival of small businesses.
The social and economic reintegration of returnees requires further support.
Further success stories under CARDS include the establishment of the Indirect Taxation Authority and the introduction of the value added tax.
The European Commission has substantially invested in the reform process of the judiciary.
The Commission assists in the implementation of the police laws which had been agreed in 2008, has successfully supported professional training of the police forces and has invested in the improvement of technical standards.
Despite the efforts of EC assistance to support key reform priorities, progress has been rather limited in terms of state building, governance and rule of law implementation, as well as in the approximation to European Standards.
The complex constitutional set-up, insufficient political support and an overall weak administrative capacity have not been conducive to reform implementation.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS
Combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries, 2009 -2013
Several European countries maintain restrictions on entry, stay and residence based on HIV status.
These provisions are discriminatory and do not protect public health.
Statement on behalf of the European Union at the 63rd session of the General Assembly on the Implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, New York, 16 June 2009.
Political situation – declarations and commitments
Political declarations on a European level and global initiatives define commitments and targets in the response to HIV/AIDS.
Dublin 2004, Vilnius 2004, Bremen 2007, Council conclusions 2005 and 2007, European Parliament report 2007 and 2008, UNGASS 2001/2006/2008, Millenium Development Goals 2000, Gleneagles 2005, Heiligendamm 2007.
They call upon the EU, national governments, international organisations, and civil society to act and to deliver.
The EU action plan on combating HIV/AIDS (2006-2009)
The action plan foresaw about 50 actions to be implemented by major stakeholders.
A number of key achievements relate to a stronger involvement of civil society at European level, the operational centralisation of HIV/AIDS surveillance by the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), efforts to facilitate access to affordable antiretroviral medicines, funding of prevention projects and programmes, investments in research, and a close cooperation between partners.
The HIV/AIDS Impact Assessment (2009) has a comprehensive summary of the achievements of the first Action Plan under point 5.3 and in its Annex 4.
SEC(2009) 1404.
THE RESPONSE
The overall objectives of this Communication are:
to reduce new HIV infections across all European countries by 2013;
(ii) to improve access to prevention treatment, care and support and
(iii) improving the quality of life of people living with, affected by or most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries.
All EU Member States, candidate and potential candidate countries, European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) countries and countries in the European Neighbourhood Policy area as well as the Russian Federation are invited to contribute to the implementation of these goals.
The Commission underlines the importance of mobilising all necessary efforts and resources to prevent HIV transmission effectively, to promote the human rights of PLWHA and affected communities, embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and to deliver high quality HIV treatment and care to all who need it.
OJ C 364, 18.12.2000, p. 1.
The current HIV epidemic and expected future trends are best addressed through:
Scaling up the implementation of prevention strategies, which effectively target local realities and needs, while working towards ensuring universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support,
Supporting an effective response to HIV/AIDS in priority regions, such as the mostly affected EU Member States, the Russian Federation and the most affected neighbouring countries, and
Political leadership
Early diagnoses of HIV accompanied by counselling and timely treatment play a crucial role in reducing transmission of HIV, as well as the morbidity and mortality related to HIV/AIDS.
The high numbers of HIV co-infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis and other sexually transmitted infections are another serious concern.
Legal and social situation – obstacles and particularities
The legislative framework and standards for social and health services for people affected by HIV/AIDS in Europe differ considerably between countries.
Access to services and medical treatment, as well as to prevention or harm reduction measures, is often limited.
Social exclusion, discrimination due to HIV status and the non-respect of basic human rights of PLWHA still persist.
In some countries sexual transmission of HIV can be considered a crime.
HIV/AIDS as an issue of concern for migrants is addressed differently across Europe.
supports monitoring the implementation of international commitments at country and European level, and supports international organisations such as UNAIDS in their work to mobilise political leadership in Eastern Europe
calls upon the ECDC to continue monitoring the progress in meeting commitments of the Dublin, Vilnius and Bremen Declarations
Involvement of civil society and people living with HIV/AIDS
Civil Society is a key actor in combating HIV/AIDS at all levels and it is instrumental in keeping HIV/AIDS on the political agenda.
Civil Society organisations, including those representing PLWHA and affected communities, were instrumental in developing practical and political solutions to address HIV/AIDS.
To this end, the Commission set up the HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum (CSF) in 2005.
Civil society has undergone strong internationalisation and professionalisation.
The Commission wants to ensure that civil society stays involved in HIV/AIDS related policy development and implementation and remains a front line partner in a coordinated response, sharing responsibility for meeting commitments.
Civil society should have the necessary freedom to act and to be involved at all levels in the response to HIV/AIDS across Europe and beyond.
supports the involvement of civil society organisations, including those representing PLWHA and affected communities, in planning, implementing and evaluating the response to HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries
will maintain the HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum as the principal interface to advise the Commission and the HIV/AIDS Think Tank
Equal treatment and solidarity are key assets of tolerant and open societies.
Any form of HIV/AIDS related discrimination and stigmatisation is unacceptable.
National policies should prioritise improvements across the general population of basic knowledge on HIV/AIDS and the prevention of HIV transmission.
Unprejudiced attitudes remove potential barriers to gaining HIV-related information and may support risk reducing behaviour patterns.
HIV/AIDS associated stigma and discrimination create barriers to access HIV testing, treatment and care.
The Commission will further address this issue on a political level and in its equal treatment policies.
Directives in the area of anti-discrimination are:
the Racial Equality Directive, 2000/43/EC, and the Employment Equality Directive, 2000/78/EC.
Council Directive 2000/43/EC implements the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.
reiterates the need to ensure the respect for the human rights of all persons irrespective of their health status, sexual orientation, lifestyle, national and social origin
will work with all relevant stakeholders and public authorities to step up awareness raising efforts and to initiate public campaigns on HIV/AIDS
encourages wider professional training on HIV, in particular in the health and social sectors as well as in law enforcement and education
Universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support
Adequate funding and political support is necessary to achieve 'universal access' across Europe.
Political leadership is an important asset the European Union can provide in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatised condition which, within the European Union and its neighbouring countries, mainly affects marginalised groups.
Not addressing the HIV epidemic would cause considerable harm to the individual and public health, and increasing costs to societies.
An effective response to HIV requires political leadership to ensure that the health and rights of vulnerable and affected groups are promoted.
Political leadership is important to define and assure the implementation of priorities and actions.
Unambiguous political advocacy is indispensable to align these priorities to needs and resources.
The Commission
underscores the need to link the response to HIV/AIDS with the socio-economic priorities in political strategies at country level
continues to support activities that aim at (1) to decreasing HIV-related stigma, (2) promoting respect for the human rights of all PLWHA and (3) addressing all forms of HIV-related discrimination and support the social inclusion of PLWHA
promotes the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS-related issues across EU policies, legislation and agreements
Prevention of HIV transmission is possible and it is the most effective way to address HIV/AIDS.
Targeted and evidence-based prevention strategies addressing local realities and priority populations are key to success.
Effective prevention measures are cost-effective investments with substantial long-term benefits.
Effective prevention requires a solid evidence base and robust surveillance systems, including meaningful behavioural data to ensure that the key forces behind the epidemic are adequately addressed.
Positive prevention and the sexual and reproductive health and rights of PLWHA are important aspects for national policy planning and programmes.
Prevention should promote safer sexual behaviour.
Correct and consistent use of condoms remains the most effective means of HIV prevention through sexual transmission, and provision of sterile needles and injecting equipment and substitution treatment are the most effective means of HIV prevention through injecting drug use.
Prevention should properly address the situation of children and young people.
Cf. the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, that has been ratified by all EU Member States.
There are also effective means to avoid mother-to-child-transmission, which should be widely applied.
Prevention should be linked to voluntary and counselled HIV testing, universal access to treatment, care and support.
In implementing the strategy, EU intervention will primarily target priority regions and most at risks populations.
COM(2009) 150 final
Proposal for a
DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) through a flexibility mechanism, within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million over and above the relevant headings of the financial framework.
Eligibility rules applicable to the contributions from the Fund are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission services have carried out a thorough examination of the application submitted by Spain in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1927/2006 and in particular with Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 thereof.
At its initiative the Commission proposes to mobilise technical assistance in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) 1927/2006.
The most important elements of the assessments can be summarised as follows:
Case EGF/2008/004 ES/Castilla y Léon and Aragón
The application was received by the Commission from the Spanish authorities on 29 December 2008 and complemented by additional information received on 8 January, 17 and 23 February 2009.
It was based upon the specific intervention criteria of Article 2(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and was submitted within the deadline of 10 weeks referred to in Article 5 of that Regulation.
Spain submitted this application under the intervention criterion of Article 2(b) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 1,000 redundancies over a 9-month period in a NACE 2 (statistical classification of economic activities) REV 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) level.
The application demonstrates that a total of 1,082 redundancies occurred in twelve enterprises classified in the NACE 2 REV 2 division 29 ('manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers') and all located in two contiguous regions at NUTS II level during the 9-month period of reference (from 31 January 2008 to 31 October 2008).
Analysis of the link between the redundancies and the major structural changes in world trade patterns is based on the following information.
Spain argues that for nine of the dismissing enterprises the redundancies result from an increase in imports of motor cars and their components into the Community and a decrease in the Community market share in the production of motor vehicles.
For the remaining three dismissing enterprises, also affected by the deteriorating position of Community motor car production on the world market, the dismissals are a direct result of a delocalisation of production to countries outside the Community:
Lear Corporation is moving its production from Avila to Morocco, Iberian Nissan Motor from Avila to Taiwan and Delphi Packard Spain from Zaragoza to Turkey.
The application uses EUROSTAT trade statistics for the Community-25 to illustrate a substantial increase (in value) between 2003 and 2007 of imports into the Community of motor vehicles in general and passenger cars in particular.
For motor vehicles imports increased by 45 % and exports by 31 %, for passenger cars imports increased by 44 % and exports by only 22 %.
Spain, in particular, which until 2004 was a net exporter of motor cars and motor vehicle components, became a net importer and this trend is continuing, with a trade deficit growing annually.
The applicant further refers to motor vehicle production statistics to demonstrate a decrease of the Community market share between 2004 and 2007.
The Community-27 market share in the world production of motor vehicles decreased from 28.4 % in 2004 to 26.9 % in 2007.
In the same period, the production in absolute terms increased by 7.5 % in the Community-27, against a growth rate of 13.3 % worldwide.
As has been shown in the Commission assessment on previous EGF cases, this decrease in Community market share is part of a lasting trend.
In 2001 the Community-27 share in world car production was still 33.7%.
The local and regional impact is set out as follows in the application :
The territories concerned by the redundancies are the autonomous communities of Castilla y León and Aragón, within which the provinces of Avila, Salamanca and Zaragoza are the most affected, given a strong presence of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in these areas.
The number of workers in the motor car industry as a whole in Spain decreased significantly over the last four years.
In 2007 alone, about 10,000 jobs were lost in this sector, and the applicant expects that, for 2008, this number will be even higher.
In the motor car component industry alone, the number of workers decreased from more than 251,000 in 2004 to 245,000 in 2007.
Given the strong presence of the motor car industry in some provinces in Castilla y León and of Aragón, these provinces are significantly impacted by the reduction of employment in this sector.
In Castilla y León, the number of registered unemployed workers increased by 3 % from 117,479 in January 2008 to 121,182 in September 2008.
For the province of Avila that is the most affected by the dismissals in this application, in particular those in Lear Corporation and in Nissan Motor Ibérica, the number of unemployed workers increased during the same period by 12 % from 7,993 to 8,976.
In Aragón, the number of registered unemployed workers increased by 23 % from 41,192 in January 2008 to 50,818 in September 2008.
For the province of Zaragoza, which is the most affected by the dismissals in this application, the number of unemployed workers increased during the same period by 26 % from 30,446 to 38,431.
In conclusion, in these circumstances, the redundancies can be seen to have a significantly negative effect on the local economy.
Of the 1,082 workers made redundant, Spain decided to target 588 workers for assistance, namely the workers made redundant by Lear Corporation and Nachi industrial, both located in Castilla y León and by Delphi Packard España Automotive Connections and Equipments, Auxiliar de Componentes Eléctricos located in Aragón.
The applicant explains that, for the redundant workers in the other enterprises in the Castilla y Léon, where smaller number of redundancies occurred, it has not been possible to reach agreement with the representatives of the workers and the enterprises on a package of measures for their re-integration into the labour market, because of their profile, their predisposition to find a new job or other reasons.
As regards the workers made redundant in the region of Aragón, the applicant states that the workers with the biggest difficulties for re-integration into the labour market are targeted for assistance from the EGF.
The criteria used for the selection were not only the economic characteristics of the area concerned, but also the skills, the capacity to adapt, the gender and the previous work experience of the workers concerned.
As regards the fulfilment of the criteria set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 the application provided the following elements:
The Spanish authorities confirmed that the financial contribution from the EGF does not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements and demonstrated that the actions provide support for individual workers and are not to be used for restructuring companies or sectors.
The Spanish authorities confirmed that the eligible actions do not receive assistance from other Community financial instruments.
In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, it is proposed to accept application EGF/2008/004 ES/Castilla y León and Aragón submitted by Spain , relating to the redundancies in twelve enterprises involved in manufacturing activities in NACE 2 REV 2 division 29 ('manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers') in two contiguous NUTS II regions Castilla y León (ES41) and Aragón (ES24), as evidence has been provided that these redundancies result from major structural changes in world trade patterns which have led to a serious economic disruption, affecting employment and the local economy.
A co-ordinated package of eligible personalised services has been proposed of which the requested contribution of the EGF is EUR 2 694 300.
Proposal for a
DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
establishing a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress Microfinance Facility)
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 159(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty,
Whereas:
The Commission Communication "A European initiative for the development of micro-credit in support of growth and employment" identified four priority areas for action:
COM(2007) 708.
improving the legal and institutional environment in the Member States, changing the climate in favour of employment and entrepreneurship, promotion of best practises and providing additional financial capital for microfinance institutions.
As a first step in implementing this agenda, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) created JASMINE in 2008 which provides mentoring for non-bank microcredit finance institutions and a financing window for a global amount of EUR 20 million offered by the EIB.
The European Parliament in its resolution of 24 March 2009 requested that the Commission reinforces its efforts to develop microcredits in support of growth and employment and offered an additional EUR 4 million of support for a pilot action to be implemented in the context of the JASMINE framework.
The European Parliament also called on the Commission to cofinance projects for microcredits in particular for disadvantaged target groups.
The ongoing Community and national efforts need to be strengthened to increase the supply of micro-credits to a sufficient scale and within a reasonable time-frame so as to address the high demand of those who need it most in this period of crisis i.e. unemployed or vulnerable people, including the young who want to start or develop a micro enterprise including self-employment but do not have access to credit.
The Commission Communication "A Shared Commitment for Employment" underlined the need to offer a new chance to the unemployed and open the road to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including the young.
In addition to existing instruments, specific action is needed to further strengthen economic and social cohesion by reinforcing activities undertaken by the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund and other international financial institutions without prejudice to the activities of the Member States.
The Commission therefore announced a proposal for a new EU microfinance facility to deepen the outreach of microfinance to particular at-risk groups and to further support the development of entrepreneurship, the social economy and micro-enterprises.
Using Community resources is appropriate and responds to the Resolution of the European Parliament of March 2009.
Further, a single pan-EU facility would concentrate leverage from international financial institutions and avoid a dispersed approach thus increasing micro-finance supply in all Member States.
The actions financed by the Facility should be coherent and compatible with the other Community policies and comply with the provisions of the Treaty and of acts adopted under it.
The activities of the Facility should be complementary to other Community interventions, in particular the CIP financial instruments, JASMINE and the European Social Fund.
For the purposes of this decision, “microfinance” refers to micro-credit and risk-sharing coverage.
The Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises defines “micro-credit” as loans under EUR 25 000 and “micro-enterprise” as an enterprise employing less than 10 people, including self employment, and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 2 million;
HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
Establishment
A European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion, called the Progress Microfinance Facility (hereinafter “the Facility”), is hereby established.
Objective
The Facility shall provide Community resources to increase access to micro-credits for:
persons who have lost or are at risk of losing their job and want to start their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment;
disadvantaged persons, including the young, who want to start or further develop their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment;
micro-enterprises in the social economy which employ persons who have lost their job or which employ disadvantaged persons, including the young.
Budget
The financial contribution from the Community budget for the Facility for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013 shall be EUR 100 million.

Management
The Commission shall manage the Facility in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
To implement the actions referred to in Article 4(1), except for the support measures referred to in point (d) of Article 4(1), the Commission shall conclude agreements with international financial institutions, in particular with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF), in accordance with Article 53d of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and Article 43 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.
These agreements shall contain detailed provisions for the implementation of the tasks entrusted to them, including the necessity to ensure additionality with national schemes.
Upon closure of the Facility, the remaining balance due to the European Communities shall be repaid to the general budget of the European Communities.
The international financial institutions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall conclude written agreements with the public and private providers of microfinance referred to in Article 4 (2) laying down their obligations to use the resources made available from the Facility in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 2 and to provide information for the establishment of the annual reports referred to in Article 8 (1).
The budget for support measures referred to in Article 4 (1) (d) shall be managed by the Commission.
Compliance
Actions financed by the Facility shall comply with the provisions of the Treaty and of acts adopted under it.
Protection of the Communities' financial interests
The Commission shall ensure that, when actions financed under this Decision are implemented, the financial interests of the Community are protected by the application of measures to prevent fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95, Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council.
For the Community actions financed under this Decision, OLAF has the power to carry out investigations on the basis of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, which shall apply to any infringement of a provision of Community law, including infringements of a contractual obligation stipulated on the basis of the facility, resulting from an act or omission by an economic operator, which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the general budget of the European Union or budgets managed by it, by an unjustified item of expenditure.
All implementing measures resulting from this Decision shall provide a reference to the above mentioned paragraphs and provide, in particular, for supervision and financial control by the Commission or any representative authorised by it, and by audits by the European Court of Auditors, if necessary on-the-spot audits.
Annual report

Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe
Introduction
The renewed Lisbon agenda on growth and jobs aims at delivering stronger, lasting growth and creating more and better jobs.
Furthermore, the mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper stresses the key role of innovation in ensuring sustainable, efficient and competitive mobility in Europe.
Against this background several major challenges have to be overcome for Europe’s transport system to play its full role in satisfying the mobility needs of the European economy and society:
Road traffic congestion is estimated to affect 10 % of the road network, and yearly costs amount to 0.9-1.5 % of the EU GDP.
Road transport accounts for 72 % of all transport-related CO2 emissions, which increased by 32 % (1990-2005) .
DG TREN (2008):
Cf. footnote 4.
These challenges are even more pressing with forecast growth rates of 50 % for freight transport and 35 % for passenger transport in the period from 2000 to 2020.
The main policy objectives arising from these challenges are for transport and travel to become:
SESAR:
Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research
Inland waterways are introducing River Information Services (RIS) to manage waterway utilisation and the transport of freight.
The railway network is gradually introducing the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and Telematics Applications for Freight (TAF-TSI).
Shipping has introduced SafeSeaNet and Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Information Systems (VTMIS) and is progressing towards an Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Long-Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT).
Examples of Intelligent Transport Systems applications in road transport include urban and motorway traffic management and control systems, electronic toll collection and route navigation.
But until now there has been no similar coherent European framework for interconnection between road and the other transport modes.
Scope
This Action Plan aims to accelerate and coordinate the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in road transport, including interfaces with other transport modes.
The Action Plan outlines six priority areas for action.
For each area a set of specific actions and a clear timetable are identified.
Fulfilling them by setting a framework to define procedures and specification will call for the mobilisation of Member States and other stakeholders.
Finally, this Action Plan will help to combine the resources and instruments available to deliver a substantial added value for the European Union.
Why a European approach for ITS?
ITS can create clear benefits in terms of transport efficiency, sustainability, safety and security, whilst contributing to the EU Internal Market and competitiveness objectives.
In Europe, there have been a number of activities in this domain since the 1980s.
These activities have traditionally focused, albeit often in an uncoordinated and fragmented manner, on specific areas such as clean and energy-efficient transport, road congestion, traffic management, road safety, security of commercial transport operations or urban mobility.
Despite these developments, some issues need to be addressed from a European perspective to avoid the emergence of a patchwork of ITS applications and services:
geographical continuity, interoperability of services and systems and standardisation.
They should facilitate pan-European applications, secure accurate and reliable real-time data and an adequate coverage of all travelling modes.
Greening of transport
ITS applications have an essential role to play in the greening of transport.
COM(2008) 433 — Communication on Greening Transport
Differentiated charging of vehicles by Electronic Toll Collection systems for circulating on certain routes is a way to influence traffic demand.
ITS applications for journey planning, dynamic in-vehicle navigation and eco-driving support also contribute to congestion relief, to greener mobility and to less energy consumption.
The “Green transport corridors” are an EU initiative to promote the concept of integrated freight transport, with transport modes complementing each other to enable more environmentally friendly alternatives for long-distance transport between logistics hubs.
more efficient, including energy efficient,
It is however clear, that conventional approaches such as the development of new infrastructure, will not give the necessary results on the timescales required by the magnitude of these challenges.
Innovative solutions are clearly needed if we are to achieve the rapid progress demanded by the urgency of the problems at hand.
It is high time for Intelligent Transport Systems to play their due role in enabling tangible results to emerge.
Intelligent Transport Systems
“Intelligent Transport Systems” mean applying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to transport.
These applications are being developed for different transport modes and for interaction between them (including interchange hubs).
In air transport, SESAR will be the framework for the implementation of a new generation of air traffic management.
ESC and eCall alone could save up to 6500 lives per year in the EU if fully deployed.
Better use should be made of the newest active safety systems and advanced driver assistance systems with proven benefits in terms of in-vehicle safety for the vehicle occupants and other road users (including vulnerable road users).
The European Statement of Principles on the Human Machine Interface (HMI) should be extended to allow for the proliferation of nomadic devices.
Navigation and tracking and tracing systems can help in providing remote in-route monitoring of vehicles and cargo, e.g. for the transport of dangerous goods or living animals.
They can guide truck drivers to secure parking areas, help to comply with existing regulations on driving times and rest periods, and should support a new generation of the digital tachograph.
The EU added value in ITS deployment
The potential of ITS can only be realised if its deployment in Europe is transformed from the limited and fragmented implementation that is observed today into an EU-wide one.
In this respect, the removal of existing barriers to ITS deployment will be pivotal.
The EU has a clear role to play in creating the right framework conditions for accelerated and coordinated deployment of ITS:
the policy priorities, the choice of generic ITS components to be shared or re-used, and agreement on a clear timetable.
Common European action can directly contribute to:
addressing the complexity of ITS deployment, with the large number of stakeholders involved and the need to ensure synchronisation both geographically and between the various partners
supporting the market penetration of advanced mobility services for the citizens, whilst promoting public transport alternatives to private car use
enabling the generation of scale-effects for a more cost-effective, faster and less risky deployment of ITS
accelerating the current pace of ITS deployment in road transport, and assuring the continuity of services throughout the Community
enhancing the leading role of the European ITS industry in worldwide markets by fostering the supply of innovative products and services to vehicle manufacturers, transport operators, logistics providers and users
To achieve these goals, the EU can make use of several instruments:
financial support, standardisation initiatives, legislative and non-legislative measures.
Consultations
This Action Plan was prepared on the basis of input provided by wide consultation of stakeholders.
The input was collected via a fourfold approach:
interviews with high-level stakeholders from the private and public sector;
workshops;
an internet questionnaire;
targeted discussions in existing stakeholder forums.
The interviews identified some principal needs.
Reliance on advanced ITS technology is essential for achieving this goal.
Improving transport efficiency
Production and distribution of goods rely on efficient and cost-effective multi-modal logistic chains to organise their transport across the EU and beyond, especially when just-in-time requirements are at stake.
ITS tools constitute a core enabler for the management of such logistic chains, notably in maintaining a paperless information trail in the management of the physical flow of goods (eFreight).
Real-time Traffic and Travel Information (RTTI) services, more and more combined with satellite navigation, are now being offered from both public and private sources to facilitate mobility.
In many parts of Europe ITS are already underpinning effective inter-urban and urban traffic management, fostering modal interchange at major hubs and transfer points.
In the longer term, cooperative systems based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) communication and exchange of information and, when appropriate, a GNSS positioning and time, will demonstrate their full potential.
Global Navigation Satellite System
Improving road safety and security
Research and initial deployment have shown the great potential for improving road safety of Driver Assistance Systems such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lateral Support (lane departure warning and lane change assistant), Collision Warning and Emergency Braking Systems and other applications such as eCall (emergency call), driver hypo-vigilance systems, “speed alert” and “alcohol-lock”.
The activities described here do not repeat or duplicate existing work but rather complement it, maximising synergies and focussing on outstanding priority issues in a concerted manner.
Action Area 1:
Optimal use of road, traffic and travel data
Many state-of-the-art ITS applications rely on an accurate knowledge of both the characteristics of the road network and the traffic regulations applicable (e.g. one-way streets and speed limits).
Where road safety is at stake it is essential that this information is validated and made available to all players on a fair and equitable basis, in view of ensuring a safe and orderly management of traffic.
This applies, in particular, to digital mapping, including its inherent processes for data collection, validation and timely updating.
Similar considerations apply to the provision of (real-time) traffic and travel information services.
Specific issues include the notion of “universal traffic messages”, i.e. the type of messages to be provided free of charge to all road users as a public information service, the consistency of the information between the various sources, and the need to comply with prescriptions imposed by network management operations.
The following actions are proposed:
Action
Target date
Definition of procedures for the provision of EU-wide real-time traffic and travel information services, addressing notably the following aspects:
provision of traffic information services by the private sector
provision of traffic regulation data by the transport authorities
guaranteed access by public authorities to safety-related information collected by private companies
guaranteed access by private companies to relevant public data
Optimisation of the collection and provision of road data and traffic circulation plans, traffic regulations and recommended routes (in particular for heavy goods vehicles)
Definition of procedures for ensuring the availability of accurate public data for digital maps and their timely updating through cooperation between the relevant public bodies and digital map providers, taking into account the results and recommendations of the eSafety Digital Maps Working Group.
Definition of specifications for data and procedures for the free provision of minimum universal traffic information services (including definition of the repository of messages to be provided)
Promotion of the development of national multimodal door-to-door journey planners, taking due account of public transport alternatives, and their interconnection across Europe
Continuity of traffic and freight management ITS services on European transport corridors and in conurbations
The need to accommodate rising traffic volumes, notably on the major European transport corridors and in conurbations, while promoting environmental sustainability and energy efficiency, calls for innovative transport and traffic management solutions.
ITS deployment should be policy-led and responsibilities need to be clearly identified including the role for public-private cooperation.
For stakeholder coordination, a high-level cross-sector group is necessary.
Most consulted stakeholders think that the European Union should take more responsibility for further deployment of ITS.
Priority areas for action and related measures
The six priority areas suggested build on input from public and private stakeholders and assume that ITS applications to be deployed in the short-to-medium term should be mature, sufficiently interoperable, and able to create a catalytic effect across Europe.
The Action Plan draws on a series of ongoing European Commission initiatives such as the Action Plan on Freight Transport Logistics, the Action Plan on Urban Mobility, Galileo deployment, the Greening Transport Package, the i2010 initiative on Intelligent Cars, eSafety, the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, eCall, European Technology Platforms and their strategic research agendas, CARS 21.
To be adopted in December 2008
COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL
Building a sustainable future for aquaculture
A new impetus for the Strategy for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture
SEC(2009) 453
Introduction
With a global production of nearly 52 million tonnes in 2006, world aquaculture has increased by one third since the beginning of the millennium, driven by spectacular growths in Asia and South-America.
It already provides about half of the world fish supply for human consumption and has a significant potential for further growth.
This makes it a key part of the solution to meet future demand for fish.
But developing aquaculture shall not undermine the necessity to reduce and eventually eliminate the overfishing of wild stocks in pursuit of sustainable exploitation of the oceans.
Thus aquaculture provides huge opportunities and raises considerable challenges, particularly in relation to environmental sustainability of production as well as to the quality and safety of the products.
Aquaculture is an important economic activity in certain coastal and continental areas of the EU.
closed or open, extensive or intensive, on land, in lakes, in ponds - fed by rivers or even groundwater - near the shore or offshore.
Several Community policies have an impact on this activity, and the structural policy in support of the Common Fisheries Policy has contributed significantly to the evolution of this industry in Europe.
From an artisanal and small scale activity, aquaculture has become a high-tech industry with fully integrated businesses.
The EU-27 aquaculture industry produced about 1.3 million tonnes of fish, shellfish and crustaceans in 2006, representing a turnover of around 3 billion € and generating approximately 65,000 jobs.
Current EU consumption demand accounts for about 12 millions tonnes.
The EU strategy for sustainable aquaculture adopted in 2002 has set out policy directions to promote the growth of aquaculture.
Seven years on, significant progress has been made in ensuring the environmental sustainability, safety and quality of EU aquaculture production.
Yet over the same period overall EU aquaculture production has stagnated, in stark contrast with the high growth rate in the rest of the world.
Against the background of fast-changing technologies and persisting economic and environmental challenges it is timely to take stock of the strength and weaknesses of the EU aquaculture sector.
This Communication aims to identify and address the causes of this stagnation, with a view to ensuring that the EU remains a key player in this strategic sector.
It will build on the achievements of the 2002 aquaculture strategy and on the new impetus for marine activities provided by the EU Integrated Maritime Policy.
A vision for the future of EU aquaculture
Current challenges and outlook
The EU represents one of the largest aquatic-food markets in the world, increasingly relying on imports to cover a growing demand.
It benefits from a dynamic and cutting-edge research and technology sector, advanced equipment and fish feed, qualified and trained entrepreneurs and innovative enterprises, as well as from a solid environment and health protection legal framework.
Yet the challenges for the EU aquaculture sector are numerous:
e.g. limited access to space and licensing; industry fragmentation;
limited access to seed capital or loans for innovation in a risky context (particularly with constant changes in the economic situation and in trade patterns); pressure from imports;
insufficiency of medicines and vaccines.
In addition, stringent EU rules, particularly on environmental protection, generate competitive constraints vis-à-vis competitors in Asia or Latin America.
The EU should invest in the global market, by selling its technologies and know-how in order to help tackle sustainability and safety challenges.
Building the future of the EU aquaculture industry
This demand cannot entirely be met by fish from the wild.
Even if wild stocks were recovered to Maximum Sustainable Yield levels, the rapidly expanding demand will also have to be met from aquaculture production.
The EU must meet these challenges and prepare for this growing demand in order to satisfy consumer demands.
The EU aquaculture industry of the future should be at the forefront of sustainable development.
The appropriate measures must be put into place to ensure that our industry can take a lead role in the "blue revolution", whether this concerns the production of aquatic food itself, technology and innovation, or the setting of standards and certification processes at EU and international level.
In order to achieve this goal, the aim of this Communication is to help bring about the conditions for a successful and sustainable aquaculture industry that can compete successfully in the market.
The industry should be able to cover the whole supply chain including both high value and innovative products, which meet the needs of consumers in the EU and abroad, and the production of high standard equipment for aquaculture businesses.
The production of aquaculture food and equipment must be supported by the most advanced research and technology.
Advanced research and technology must also help the aquaculture industry to be environmentally sustainable.
This would allow a number of EU aquaculture businesses and the associated technology-providing industry to invest abroad.
Market conditions will shape the way in which the industry contributes to supplying healthy and safe aquatic food products while at the same time decreasing the EU's dependence on imports.
In this regard, voluntary labelling and certification schemes compatible with WTO provisions can strengthen consumer confidence and improve the position of aquaculture products that meet rigorous quality standards.
With the help of advanced research and technology, aquaculture must be an industry that is environmentally compatible.
Environmental sustainability is a necessity and consumers also increasingly want to be assured that aquaculture products are produced and transported while fully taking account of high standard environmental requirements.
Applying high standards will eventually also improve the image of the aquaculture industry and facilitate its access to the markets.
A number of important challenges that limit the development of European aquaculture directly depend on policies and actions taken at national or regional level.
Public authorities must therefore establish an appropriate framework for this vision to become concrete, and should contribute to lifting bottlenecks in national legislation.
This framework needs to be predictable, consistent and cost effective in order to allow the industry realise its potential.
This Strategy can therefore only deliver if its vision and objectives are fully supported by all, and further strengthened and relayed by public authorities at national and regional level.
Promoting competitiveness of EU aquaculture production
In order to bring about this vision for European aquaculture, the EU should promote a competitive and diverse aquaculture industry (including equipment and technology providers), supported by the most advanced research and technology, covering the whole supply chain and meeting consumer demands in a sustainable manner.
The priority needs for sustainable aquaculture development will also be assessed in the context of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and its future financial framework.
In this context the Commission will consider in particular establishing specific funding possibilities for measures beyond the national dimension.
Research and technological development
The EU has been a key contributor to research and technological development in aquaculture.
Under the 6th Research Framework Programme, 98 million € have been allocated to research projects for aquaculture, among which 32 million € for SMEs.
It is essential to continue and reinforce such support.
The sustainable development of aquaculture should be supported by excellence in research and innovation.
Industry leaders have recently launched an initiative aimed at establishing a European Aquaculture Technology and Innovation Platform (EATIP), with the view to enabling it to maintain its world leadership, and to provide a strategic vision and define priorities for the European aquaculture sector with respect to research and technological development.
Technological innovations in farming systems have proven efficient means for the aquaculture industry to reduce their environmental impacts.
It is essential to further support excellence in research and technological development in aquaculture, to promote private initiatives in this area and to expand the opportunities for its financing.
Public funded research may act as a lever to private R&D and should concentrate on priorities, especially those that cannot be fully supported by SMEs or with high investments risks.
In this context, synergies with maritime activities should also be found (e.g. offshore aquaculture).
The Commission
Will pursue efforts in aquaculture R&D, and allocate a sufficient EU budget to aquaculture projects to further develop the knowledge-base for sustainable and competitive aquaculture practices.
The Commission will also look for a more efficient use of existing instruments at European level.
In parallel, Members States and the industry are invited to increase their investment in aquaculture research in the context of the European Research Area;
Will promote optimisation and development of key research infrastructures and reinforce networks and integration into broader scientific networks to address global challenges such as adaptation to climate change in the context of the new Maritime Policy and its strategic research agenda;
Invites Member States to recognise the importance of extensive and traditional forms of aquaculture and to consider possibilities of developing production in existing sites and facilities.
Furthermore, adequate insurance, covering stock and/or technology related risks, can play a significant role in supporting the development of the aquaculture industry, especially of innovative projects where the impact of losses may be considerable.
The Commission will therefore analyse the impact of the projects and consider whether it is appropriate to adapt the current Guidelines for the Examination of State Aid to Fisheries and Aquaculture.
Equal competitor in terms of space
The increasing competition for space represents a major challenge for further developing or even maintaining all forms of coastal aquaculture, as well as freshwater fish-farming.
Area choice is crucial and spatial planning has a key role to play in providing guidance and reliable data for the location of an economic activity, giving certainty to investors, avoiding conflicts and finding synergies between activities and environments with the ultimate aim of sustainable development.
Will continue its initiatives to promote the development of maritime spatial planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management, as identified in the framework of the new EU Maritime Policy;
Invites all Member States to develop marine spatial planning systems, in which they fully recognise the strategic importance of aquaculture.
In this context, as part of the preparation of the next reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Commission will consider the possibility to strengthen the linkages between Community financial instruments and the issue of access to space for maritime activities, including aquaculture;
Invites Member States to ensure that terrestrial land planning fully integrates the needs and values of freshwater aquaculture.
Enabling the aquaculture business to cope with market demands
The EU aquaculture industry should be able to answer to consumer demands, be adaptable to changing market requirements and be capable of interacting on an equal footing with the other actors of the marketing chain.
Assess and address needs of the aquaculture sector, in particular regarding producer organisations, inter-professions, consumer information and marketing instruments such as labelling of aquatic food products, in the framework of the future reform of the market policy for fisheries and aquaculture products;
Continue its work with Member States, the European Parliament and stakeholders to develop and promote standards (notably on organic aquaculture or on Eco-labelling Schemes);
Continue its international cooperation on labelling and certification issues, notably with the FAO.
The International dimension
An innovative industry is also an opportunity for the associated sectors (e.g. equipment, fish feed, animal health industries) to expand and export their know-how to other parts of the world.
In this context, the Commission will
Consider establishing a basis for promoting aquaculture development in third countries and to increase business opportunities for EU aquaculture firms, in the framework of the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy;
Develop, in the context of its new animal health action plan, an export strategy at Community level in order to strengthen the Community role in negotiating export conditions related to animal health issues;
Continue to promote the need for sustainability in aquaculture development at international level with a view to improve the environmental record of some present practices and improve the level playing field for this sector at a global level.
Establishing conditions for sustainable growth of aquaculture
The Community shall ensure that the EU aquaculture industry develops in a way which is compatible with a high level of protection of the natural environment.
On the same lines, aquatic food products that are manufactured in or imported to the EU shall comply with high protection standards of consumer health and safety.
The Community should also pursue its objectives for a high level of protection of health and welfare in farmed aquatic animals.
Ensuring compatibility between aquaculture and the environment
An environmentally-friendly aquaculture
The EU is committed to a high level of environmental protection and Community legislation is based on the precautionary principle.
Technologies for cleaning water by removing wastes and contaminants are available and the further development of new technologies to decrease effluent is also likely to be significant in the coming years.
Compliance with Community water legislation is also crucial to ensuring the water quality needed to produce quality and safe food.
The Commission will
Continue to emphasise the importance of environmentally sustainable development of aquaculture in its policies and actions;
Continue to monitor developments in terms of escapees and if necessary, assess the added value of possible action at the EU level.
An aquaculture-friendly environment
The first river basin management plans developed by Member States under the water framework Directive shall, as a minimum, maintain the present protection level of shellfish growing areas as afforded by the Directive on shellfish water quality.
The Commission also believes that the first update of the river basin management plans in 2015 should, as a minimum, maintain the same level of protection and that newly designated areas for the production of shellfish should be designated as protected areas.
The lesser duty rule requires the measures imposed by the Community to be lower than the dumping or subsidy margin, if such lower duty rate is sufficient to remove the injury suffered by the Community industry.
1.2.1. The international framework
The principle of liberalisation of imports was set under the GATT 1947 and strengthened under the 1994 WTO Agreements.
As safeguard measures consist of the unilateral withdrawal or suspension of a tariff concession or of other trade liberalisation obligations formerly agreed, they have to be considered as an exception to this principle.
The current Community safeguard instruments are covered by the following regulations:
Each of the sub-options implies impacts, to a varying degree, in the following areas.
Increased access to social protection as persons seeking asylum would have increased chances of accessing asylum procedures and, where applicable, obtaining protection, including the necessary social and healthcare.
The same consideration applies to better public health;
Increased equality/non-discrimination: in particular the provisions that promote de facto equality in asylum procedures (special guarantees for women and vulnerable applicants), the provisions on access to effective remedy and improved procedural guarantees are key components of the preferred option that will enhance equality and non-discrimination;
Good governance: would be better achieved within MSs through the introduction of a single determining authority and providing personnel with necessary skills and expertise.
Quantifying costs of changes to the CEAS is particularly difficult.
Protection is granted on a case by case basis, based on a complex analysis which is context specific, and depends on a number of legal and factual circumstances.
No data exist as to why, over a given period, certain applications have been accepted and others rejected.
The size or profile of asylum flows cannot be predicted from year to year.
The available indications concerning the principal elements of the preferred option are the following:
10 MS that would be potentially affected by the envisaged provisions on personal interviews received in total 111 650 applicants in 2008.
5 MS that would be affected by envisaged measures on facilitating access to procedures at the maritime border received 56 985 applicants in 2008.
Provisions on free legal assistance at first instance would affect at least 11 MS which received 125 255 applicants in 2008.
Many costs could be largely off-set by financial gains in the longer term.
Potential savings may result from diminished secondary movements and improved efficiency of first instance procedures.
By front-loading services, expertise and examinations, the preferred option should reduce recourse to appeals leading to administrative and financial savings.
There are indications that appeals can double the cost of an asylum claim whereas an estimated 110846 appeals were lodged in 2007.
Additionally, it would entail a reduction of the costs involved in reception services.
On average, 1 reception year may cost EUR 11000 per person whereas the envisaged length of first instance procedures is 6 months, while appeal procedures often take at least 1 year.
National measures to implement the standards of the proposal are eligible for co-funding under the European Refugee Fund at a level of 50% or 75%.
The programme rightly plans the resumption of fiscal consolidation as soon as the economy recovers.
Financial corrections
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Without appropriate data, the Commission is not in a position to:
- analyse the likely evolution of EU energy infrastructure, detect any potential gaps and anticipate future energy supply;
- promote transparency on the likely evolution of the EU energy system.
4.1. Introduction
The 2008 agricultural year was marked by very sharp and remarkable decreases in the prices of many agricultural products in both the EU and world markets towards the end of the budget year.
These decreases in prices concerned mainly crop and dairy products while meat prices showed a recovery.
A brief commentary on the use of the 2008 agricultural budget's available appropriations is hereby presented.
Payments amounted to EUR4159.3million.
As regards pig-meat, the expenditure incurred over-implemented the sector's appropriations.
The appropriations for the sectors of sugar and wine were under-implemented.
The main reasons for these implementation patterns are briefly presented below:
5.1.2. Article 05 02 01: Cereals
5.2.1. Borrowing/lending operations
The loan repayments are scheduled to match the repayments of the borrowings due from the Community.
This method is used so that the Community can immediately repay the borrowing on the date scheduled in the event of late payment by the recipient of the loan;
The funds obtained are used to replenish the Commission's cash resources;
For EIB loans, default interest is calculated during the period between the due date of a defaulted loan instalment and the date of receipt of the cash resources by the EIB from the Commission.
Explanatory notes for country-risk indicators
They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3.
Typical examples are programmes designed to prepare students for studies at level 5 who, although having completed ISCED level 3, did not follow a curriculum which would allow entry to level 5, i.e. pre-degree foundation courses or short vocational programmes.
The term Early-Stage Researcher refers to researchers in the first four years (full-time equivalent) of their research activity, including the period of research training.
